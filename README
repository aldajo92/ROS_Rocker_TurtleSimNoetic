## ROS and Rocker: Turtlebot3 ##

This repository contains the Dockerfile for the turtlebot3 simulation, using [Rocker](https://github.com/osrf/rocker) (Docker tool) and the docker base image `noetic-desktop-full`.

## Ubuntu 22.04 LTS ##

(Pending)

### Mac OS (M1/M2 chip) ###

Disclaimer: This process require to run with parallels desktop app. I'm not receiving any compensation for this recommendation. I just found it very useful for my work. If you have a better solution, I will be happy to hear it.

1. Install [parallels desktop](https://www.parallels.com/products/desktop/).

2. Install Ubuntu 22.04 LTS VM as follows:
    - Once parallels is installed, click on the "+" sign on the top right corner of the window and select "Install Windows or another OS from a DVD or image file".
    - Select Ubuntu with x86_64 emulation.

    - Proceed with the installation. Then Click on Download.

3. Wait until parallels finishes installing Ubuntu. Once it is done, you should set a password for the user "parallels" and then log in.

4. Validate if docker is installed:
    Parallels comes with docker pre-installed. To validate if it is installed, open a terminal and run the following command:
    ```
    $ docker --version
    ```
5. Add the user "parallels" to the docker group:
    ```
    $ sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
    $ sudo newgrp docker
    ```
6. Clone this repository in a specific path:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/aldajo92/ROS_Rocker_Turtlebot3SimNoetic.git /desired/path
$ cd /desired/path
```

7. Configure [Rocker](https://github.com/osrf/rocker):
- Setup the ROS package:
```
$ sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu focal main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'
$ sudo apt install curl # if you haven't already installed curl
$ curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.asc | sudo apt-key add -
```

- And install rocker: 
```
$ sudo apt-get install python3-rocker
```

8. Build and execute the docker image:
```
$ ./scripts/build.sh
$ ./scripts/run.sh
```

You should see somethin like follows:

The above image has a configuration in the OS for the display with a resolution 2048x1152(16:9).
